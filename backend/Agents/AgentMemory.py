question = " Youâ€™ve managed projects before; describe a situation where you had to adjust your project plan due to unforeseen circumstances. How did you re-allocate resources and maintain stakeholder communication during this change, and what metrics did you use to track the impact of this adjustment?"
template = """
      *   **Expected Approach:** The candidate should describe a specific project example where a change occurred. They should explain the 
original plan, the nature of the unforeseen circumstance, and the steps taken to re-allocate resources (e.g., shifting team members, re-
prioritizing tasks) and maintain communication (e.g., updated timelines, regular meetings, specific notifications of changed aspects) with both 
internal and external stakeholders. The response should include specific metrics like schedule variance, budget adjustments, client satisfaction 
scores to show how they tracked progress and the impact of these changes. The answer should demonstrate clear decision making, 
communication effectiveness, and adaptation.
        *  **Criteria:** Must include an specific example, clearly stating the initial plan, the unexpected event, mitigation strategies,  and metrics 
used to track impacts of changes. The user should show how they took charge by actively re-assessing and acting on the project to minimise 
the losses
