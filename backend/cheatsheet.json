            "answer": "In my role at We45, I implemented RAG using OWASP data to enhance vulnerability analysis within our \"ThreatPlaybook\" tool. RAG was crucial in providing our LLM with up-to-date and relevant information, addressing the common problem of LLMs lacking specific domain knowledge or having outdated information. Specifically, we used OWASP guidelines and vulnerability databases as our external knowledge source. When a user queries the system about a potential threat, the system first retrieves relevant OWASP data using semantic search techniques. This retrieved data is then combined with the user's query and fed to the LLM. This allows the LLM to generate more accurate and contextually relevant threat scenarios, mitigations, and security objectives. Before RAG, the LLM would sometimes generate generic advice that lacked specific relevance to the vulnerability in question. After RAG implementation, the output was significantly improved, providing actionable and tailored security recommendations.",

            "answer": "At Georgia Tech, I built knowledge graphs to improve question-answering on credit agreements. My approach involved a layered architecture consisting of an ontology layer and a data layer. The ontology layer defines the core concepts within credit agreements (e.g., 'Party', 'Obligation', 'Clause') and their relationships (e.g., 'Party HAS Obligation', 'Clause GOVERNS Obligation'). We used RDF and OWL to represent this ontology. The data layer populates the ontology with specific instances extracted from credit agreement documents. We used techniques like named entity recognition (NER) and relationship extraction to identify entities and relations. This resulted in a graph where nodes are entities (parties, clauses) and edges represent relationships between them. For multi-level query generation, we employed SPARQL queries of varying complexity. Simple queries could retrieve basic information about a party. More complex queries could traverse the graph to identify all obligations of a specific party governed by a particular clause. This graph-based approach allowed for a more nuanced and complete understanding of the document compared to traditional keyword-based search.",

What are the key considerations when selecting a pre-trained model for a specific NLP task, and how do you evaluate the effectiveness of your fine-tuning process? Can you share specific evaluation metrics you've used?",
            "answer": "When selecting a pre-trained transformer for a specific NLP task, several factors are considered. First, the model's architecture and pre-training objective are important. For example, if the task involves sequence-to-sequence generation, models like BART or T5 might be preferred. For tasks requiring contextual understanding, models like BERT or RoBERTa are good starting points. Second, the size of the model and available computational resources are key constraints. Larger models often perform better but require more memory and training time. Third, the pre-training data is important. A model pre-trained on a domain similar to the target task is likely to perform better. When fine-tuning, I focus on task-specific metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. For sequence generation tasks, I use metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR. Monitoring the training and validation loss curves during fine-tuning is also crucial to identify overfitting. I also perform ablation studies by varying hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size) and fine-tuning strategies (layer freezing) to optimize performance.",

            "answer": "Processing legal documents presents several challenges. Legal language is often complex, technical, and ambiguous, with long sentences and nested clauses. In my Semeval'24 project on legal text classification, we addressed these challenges using several techniques. First, we preprocessed the text to remove irrelevant information and standardize the format. This involved tasks like tokenization, stemming, and stop word removal. Second, we used domain-specific embeddings to capture the semantic meaning of legal terms. We used pre-trained word embeddings and fine-tuned them on a corpus of legal texts. Third, we employed Weighted Multi-Level Fusion to combine information from different levels of the document (sentences, paragraphs, sections). This allowed us to capture both local and global context. We also used similarity-based unsupervised learning to identify relevant patterns and features in the data. This helped us to handle the ambiguity and complexity of legal language and improve the accuracy of our classification model. The 60% increase in Macro F1 score over the baseline model demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.",

            "answer": "In developing 'SheRise', I integrated Google Vertex AI's Dialogflow with a generative fallback to offer personalized support for survivors of harassment. Dialogflow handled structured conversational flows, recognizing user intents and extracting entities related to their situation (e.g., type of harassment, location). When Dialogflow couldn't match a user query to a predefined intent (due to complex or unexpected input), the generative fallback, powered by a large language model, stepped in. This ensured the chatbot could still provide a relevant and supportive response, even if the user's input was unstructured or nuanced. The benefit of a generative fallback is improved user experience. It makes the chatbot more resilient and adaptable, capable of handling a wider range of user queries. It prevents the conversation from stalling and ensures the user always receives some form of helpful response, enhancing engagement and trust.

The primary challenge is the lack of labeled data for training machine learning models. Other challenges include the scarcity of pre-trained language models and linguistic resources, as well as the complexity of the language itself. To address these challenges, I utilized several techniques. First, I employed data augmentation techniques to generate synthetic training data. This involved creating new question-answer pairs by paraphrasing existing ones and using back-translation methods. Second, I leveraged transfer learning by fine-tuning pre-trained language models on a small amount of labeled data. Although there were no pre-trained Sanskrit models, I used related languages and models and fine-tuned them. Third, I used Haystack framework for annotating over 4000+ question-answer pairs to build a SQuAD-like dataset.

When assessing Llama 3.1 8B for question answering, I focus on metrics that capture both accuracy and the ability to maintain coherence and relevance over extended inputs. Key metrics include: (1) Context Recall: Measures the ability of the model to retrieve and utilize relevant information from the entire context. (2) Answer Relevance: Assesses how well the answer addresses the specific question being asked, considering the context provided. (3) Coherence: Evaluates the logical flow and consistency of the answer, particularly when drawing information from different parts of the long context.

Given the limited availability of labeled data, unsupervised techniques were crucial for identifying underlying patterns and structures within the legal text. Specifically, I applied techniques like topic modeling (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to discover recurring themes and arguments within the documents. I also used clustering algorithms (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering) to group similar legal cases based on their textual content. The advantages of this approach included the ability to work with unlabeled data, the discovery of hidden relationships and patterns, and reduced reliance on manual feature engineering. However, there were limitations. Unsupervised methods can be sensitive to noise and outliers, and the interpretation of the resulting clusters or topics can be subjective.

            "answer": "The Agentic LLM Workflow for ThreatPlaybook was designed to automate threat modeling by simulating the thought process of a security expert. It involves several key components that interact in a sequential manner. First, the *Goal Setting Agent* defines the high-level objectives of the threat model based on the system architecture and assets. Second, the *Scenario Generation Agent* uses LLMs to brainstorm potential threat scenarios, leveraging knowledge of common attack vectors and vulnerabilities. Third, the *Mitigation Strategy Agent* analyzes each scenario and proposes appropriate mitigation strategies, drawing from security best practices and compliance standards. Fourth, the *Security Objective Definition Agent* translates the mitigations into specific, measurable security objectives that can be tracked and monitored. The Agentic workflow enables the ThreatPlaybook to generate realistic threat scenarios, tailored mitigations, and actionable security objectives, significantly reducing the manual effort involved in traditional threat modeling.

PyTorch is known for its flexibility, dynamic computation graphs, and Pythonic interface, making it easier to debug and iterate on models. This makes it well-suited for research and rapid prototyping. I often choose PyTorch when exploring new model architectures or experimenting with custom training loops. TensorFlow, on the other hand, is known for its scalability, production readiness, and strong ecosystem. Its static computation graphs allow for more efficient deployment and optimization, and TensorFlow Extended (TFX) provides a comprehensive set of tools for building end-to-end machine learning pipelines. I would typically choose TensorFlow for large-scale deployments and production environments where performance and reliability are critical. TensorFlow also has excellent support for distributed training, making it ideal for training very large models on clusters of machines. For example, I would use TensorFlow for deploying a model to serve predictions in a high-throughput environment.",

This has several advantages, including reduced development time, improved model performance, and the ability to generalize to new data. Traditional feature engineering often requires significant domain expertise and can be time-consuming. Representation learning techniques, such as word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe) and autoencoders, can automatically learn meaningful representations from the data. In my IIT Kharagpur project, I used representation learning by fine-tuning pre-trained transformers. Instead of manually engineering features to represent the text, I let the model learn the relevant features from the data. This resulted in significantly better retrieval efficiency, because the model was able to capture the semantic meaning of the text more effectively. Representation learning also reduces the risk of introducing bias through manual feature engineering and allows the model to adapt to the specific characteristics of the data.",

            "answer": "Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model trained on one task is re-purposed or used as a starting point on a second related task. This is particularly useful when the target task has limited labeled data. There are several approaches to transfer learning, including fine-tuning, feature extraction, and domain adaptation. Fine-tuning involves taking a pre-trained model and training it further on the target task's data. Feature extraction involves using the pre-trained model to extract features from the target task's data and then training a new model on those features. Domain adaptation aims to adjust a model trained on one domain to perform well on a different but related domain. In my IIT Kharagpur internship, I applied transfer learning by fine-tuning custom pre-trained transformers like ALBERT and RoBERTa for enhanced retrieval efficiency in an extractive question-answering system for Sanskrit scriptures. Since there was limited data for Sanskrit, I started with models pre-trained on large English corpora and then fine-tuned them on the Sanskrit data. This significantly improved the model's ability to understand and process Sanskrit text, leading to better question-answering performance.

I had some familiarity with LLMs but limited experience specifically with agentic frameworks. My approach involved a combination of structured learning and hands-on experimentation. First, I reviewed the documentation and tutorials for Langchain which was the agentic framework used. I then identified key concepts like agents, tools, and chains. Next, I started with simple examples, gradually increasing complexity. I built a basic agent that could answer questions about security concepts. Then I incrementally added more sophisticated tools and integrated it with our existing threat modeling workflows. The biggest challenge was orchestrating the different agents. To solve this, I implemented a central dispatcher that managed the flow of information between agents, ensuring each agent received the appropriate context and instructions. Within a week, I was able to develop and deploy a working agentic workflow that significantly improved the automation of threat modeling.",

            "answer": "Supervised learning and unsupervised learning each have their own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between them depends on the specific problem and available data. Supervised learning requires labeled data, where each input is paired with a corresponding output. This allows the model to learn a direct mapping between inputs and outputs, enabling tasks like classification and regression. The advantage of supervised learning is its high accuracy and ability to make precise predictions. However, it can be limited by the availability and cost of labeled data. Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, works with unlabeled data and aims to discover underlying patterns and structures within the data. This is useful for tasks like clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection. The advantage of unsupervised learning is its ability to work with unlabeled data, which is often more readily available. However, its performance may not be as accurate as supervised learning, and the interpretation of the results can be subjective. For example, if I have a well-defined classification problem with a large amount of labeled data, I would choose supervised learning.

A core aspect was the Agentic LLM Workflow, which we designed to simulate attacker behavior and generate realistic threat scenarios. This involved several key agents: a Reconnaissance Agent to gather information, a Vulnerability Assessment Agent to identify weaknesses, an Exploitation Agent to simulate attacks, and a Reporting Agent to synthesize findings. The workflow was orchestrated using a task management system to ensure each agent's output fed into the next stage, creating a dynamic and adaptive threat model. We fine-tuned a base LLM to act as each agent, providing it with specific knowledge and tools. For instance, the Vulnerability Assessment Agent had access to a vulnerability database and could use code analysis tools.

These datasets were crucial because they provide structured information about common web application and API vulnerabilities. We indexed this data into a vector database, allowing the LLM to retrieve relevant information based on the specific context of the threat model being generated. For example, if the LLM identified a potential SQL injection vulnerability, it could retrieve information about SQL injection from the OWASP Top Ten, along with recommended mitigation strategies from the OWASP Testing Guide. This allowed the LLM to not only identify vulnerabilities but also provide context and remediation advice, making the threat model more actionable.

Credit agreements are notoriously complex, with dense legal jargon, nested clauses, and extensive cross-referencing. This makes it difficult to identify the precise text spans that answer a given question. One major challenge is ambiguity in language; the same concept might be expressed in multiple ways throughout the document. Furthermore, the agreements are often lengthy, exceeding the context window of many LLMs. To address these issues, we've implemented techniques like document chunking with semantic overlap, query expansion to handle variations in phrasing, and a multi-stage retrieval process to filter irrelevant information before feeding it to the LLM. We are also experimenting with fine-tuning LLMs on a dataset of question-answer pairs specifically created for credit agreements to improve their understanding of the legal domain.",

            "answer": "We chose RDF (Resource Description Framework) for building the knowledge graph because it's a standard model for data interchange on the Web, providing a flexible and extensible way to represent relationships between entities. The knowledge graph comprises two primary layers: an ontology layer and a data layer. The ontology layer defines the core concepts and relationships within the credit agreement domain, such as 'Borrower', 'Lender', 'Clause', 'Obligation', and 'Right'. It also specifies the properties that each entity can have (e.g., a Borrower has a 'Name' and an 'Address'). The data layer populates the ontology with specific instances extracted from the credit agreements themselves. Each entity in the data layer is linked to its corresponding concept in the ontology. This structured representation enables multi-level query generation. For instance, a simple query might retrieve the 'Name' of a 'Borrower'. A more complex query could involve traversing relationships to find all 'Obligations' of a specific 'Borrower' under a particular 'Clause'. The ontology guides the query engine to understand the semantics of the data and generate meaningful results.",

We employed metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1-score to measure the overlap between the model's generated answer and the ground truth. Additionally, we used BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) and ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) scores to evaluate the fluency and coherence of the generated text. Beyond these standard NLP metrics, we also introduced a custom metric that penalizes the model for including irrelevant information or hallucinating facts not present in the original credit agreement. Our findings indicated that Llama 3.1 8B performed reasonably well on simple factoid questions but struggled with complex queries that required synthesizing information from multiple parts of the document. The model also exhibited a tendency to hallucinate information in some cases, highlighting the need for further fine-tuning and the implementation of techniques like RAG to improve its grounding in the source text.",

First, the lack of readily available pre-trained language models for Sanskrit meant we had to rely on models trained on related languages or train our own from scratch. Second, the availability of labeled data for fine-tuning was limited. Our approach involved several steps. We began by creating a SQuAD-like dataset by manually annotating over 4000 question-answer pairs from the scriptures. We then fine-tuned pre-trained transformers like ALBERT and RoBERTa on this dataset. To further improve performance, we experimented with transfer learning from other Indic languages with more resources. We also used the Haystack framework to build the QA pipeline, allowing us to easily experiment with different retrieval and reader models.

One key approach was to use a contrastive learning objective, where the model was trained to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant document passages for a given question. We also experimented with different loss functions, such as multiple negative ranking loss, to improve the model's ability to rank relevant passages higher than irrelevant ones. Furthermore, we carefully selected the training data to include a diverse set of questions and passages, ensuring that the model was exposed to a wide range of linguistic patterns and semantic relationships. We also incorporated techniques like hard negative mining to focus the model's attention on the most challenging negative examples. Finally, we monitored retrieval metrics like Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Recall@K during fine-tuning to track the model's progress and adjust the training parameters accordingly.

The 'levels' in our approach refer to different representations of the legal text: word embeddings (word level), sentence embeddings (sentence level), and document embeddings (document level). Each level captures different aspects of the text's meaning. Word embeddings capture local semantic relationships, sentence embeddings capture contextual information within sentences, and document embeddings capture the overall theme and structure of the legal argument. We used pre-trained models like BERT to generate these embeddings. The 'weighted' part of our approach involves assigning different weights to each level based on its importance in the classification task. We determined these weights through experimentation and validation on a held-out dataset. We found that the document level representation was most important, followed by the sentence level, and then the word level. The weighted fusion was achieved by concatenating the weighted embeddings from each level and feeding them into a classifier.

Our approach involved representing each legal text as a vector embedding using pre-trained models like Sentence-BERT. We then calculated the pairwise similarity between these embeddings using various similarity measures. We explored several types of similarity measures, including cosine similarity, which measures the angle between two vectors; Euclidean distance, which measures the straight-line distance between two vectors; and Jaccard index, which measures the overlap between sets of words. We found that cosine similarity generally performed best, as it is less sensitive to the magnitude of the vectors and more focused on their direction, capturing the semantic similarity between the texts. We then used a clustering algorithm, such as K-means or hierarchical clustering, to group the legal texts based on their similarity scores. The resulting clusters represented different types of legal arguments or topics, allowing us to gain insights into the structure and organization of the legal domain without any prior knowledge.",

It leveraged Google Vertex AI's Dialogflow for intent recognition and dialogue management. Dialogflow allowed us to define intents and entities related to harassment, rape, and domestic violence, and to train the chatbot to understand user queries and extract relevant information. However, Dialogflow's response capabilities are limited to pre-defined responses. To address this, we implemented a generative fallback using Vertex AI's generative models. When Dialogflow was unable to match a user query to a pre-defined intent with sufficient confidence, it triggered the generative fallback.

            "answer": "Firebase Realtime Database was crucial for enabling live messaging within SheRise, connecting users with community members and specialists in real-time. We structured the database to store chat messages, user profiles, and community information. Each chat conversation was represented as a separate node in the database, with messages stored as child nodes. Firebase's real-time capabilities allowed us to push new messages to users instantly, creating a seamless chat experience. Regarding data privacy and security, we implemented several measures. First, we used Firebase's security rules to restrict access to user data based on authentication and authorization. Only authenticated users could access their own chat conversations, and only authorized administrators could access sensitive user information. We also encrypted all sensitive data at rest and in transit to protect it from unauthorized access. Furthermore, we implemented data retention policies to ensure that user data was deleted after a certain period of inactivity. We also provided users with the option to delete their accounts and all associated data at any time. Finally, we conducted regular security audits to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities.",

            "answer": "For the Legal Argument Reasoning project, we focused on transformer architectures known for their effectiveness in text classification tasks, particularly those capable of capturing long-range dependencies in legal text. We specifically explored BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and its variants, such as LegalBERT, which is pre-trained on a corpus of legal documents. We also experimented with RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach), which is a more optimized version of BERT that uses dynamic masking and larger batch sizes during pre-training. We chose these architectures because they have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results on a wide range of NLP tasks, including text classification, and they are readily available with pre-trained weights, allowing for transfer learning. Additionally, their bidirectional nature allows them to capture contextual information from both sides of a word, which is particularly important for understanding the nuances of legal language. We also investigated Longformer, designed to handle longer sequences, but found BERT and RoBERTa more effective after segmenting the legal documents appropriately. Ultimately, LegalBERT emerged as the best performer due to its pre-training on legal-specific data.",

            "answer": "Handling out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words in the Sanskrit scriptures was a significant challenge, especially given the limited resources available for the language. Our approach involved several techniques to mitigate the impact of OOV words. First, we used subword tokenization methods, such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) and WordPiece, to break down rare words into smaller, more frequent subword units. This allowed the model to represent OOV words as combinations of known subwords, enabling it to generalize to unseen words. Second, we incorporated character-level embeddings to capture the morphological structure of Sanskrit words. This was particularly helpful for handling inflections and derivations, which are common in Sanskrit. Third, we leveraged pre-trained embeddings from related Indic languages, such as Hindi and Marathi, to provide a semantic representation for OOV words based on their similarity to words in these languages. Fourth, we created a custom vocabulary of Sanskrit terms and phrases and added them to the model's vocabulary. Finally, we used a copy mechanism that allowed the model to copy OOV words directly from the input text to the output, ensuring that they were not lost during processing. These techniques, combined, helped us to effectively handle OOV words and improve the accuracy of the QA system.",

Bias refers to the error introduced by approximating a real-world problem, which is often complex, by a simplified model. High bias can lead to underfitting. Variance refers to the sensitivity of the model to small fluctuations in the training data. High variance can lead to overfitting. Addressing this tradeoff involves finding the right balance between model complexity and generalization ability. Techniques include cross-validation (to estimate generalization error), regularization (like L1 or L2 regularization to penalize model complexity), and ensembling methods (like Random Forests, which combine multiple models to reduce variance). For instance, using a complex neural network might give low bias but high variance. Applying dropout or early stopping can address the overfitting.",

This penalty discourages the model from learning overly complex patterns from the training data, thereby improving its ability to generalize to unseen data. Common types of regularization include L1 regularization (Lasso), which adds the absolute value of the coefficients to the loss function, encouraging sparsity (feature selection); L2 regularization (Ridge), which adds the squared value of the coefficients to the loss function, shrinking the coefficients towards zero; and Elastic Net, which is a combination of L1 and L2 regularization.

It has recurrent connections, allowing it to maintain a hidden state that captures information about past inputs. This makes RNNs suitable for tasks like natural language processing (NLP) and time series analysis. A major limitation of standard RNNs is the vanishing gradient problem, where gradients diminish as they are backpropagated through time, making it difficult to learn long-range dependencies. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks are types of RNNs designed to address this problem. They incorporate memory cells and gating mechanisms to control the flow of information, allowing them to learn and retain information over longer sequences.

                    "**Be Concise and Structured:** When answering technical questions, use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure your response. This helps you deliver a clear and well-organized answer. For example, if asked about a time you handled a large dataset, describe the original situation (e.g., 'We had a 1TB dataset of customer transactions...'), the task at hand (e.g., '...and I needed to analyze it for fraud detection...'), the actions you took (e.g., '...I used Spark to preprocess the data, engineered features like transaction frequency, and built a Random Forest model...'), and the results (e.g., '...which improved fraud detection accuracy by 15%').",
                    "**Explain Technical Concepts Clearly:** Databricks values communication, especially the ability to explain complex data science concepts to both technical and non-technical audiences. Practice explaining algorithms like Gradient Boosting or techniques like A/B testing in simple terms, using analogies if possible. For instance, you could describe Gradient Boosting as 'iteratively building models that learn from the mistakes of previous models, like a team improving a project step-by-step'.",
                    "**Actively Listen and Engage:** Pay close attention to the interviewer's questions and ensure you understand them fully before answering. If something is unclear, ask for clarification. Show genuine interest in the conversation by nodding, maintaining eye contact, and asking follow-up questions related to the interviewer's points. For example, after the interviewer describes a project, you could ask, 'That's fascinating. How did you measure the impact of that project on the company's bottom line?'",
                    "**Quantify Your Accomplishments:** Whenever possible, quantify the impact of your work using numbers and metrics. Instead of saying 'I improved model performance,' say 'I improved model performance by 10% in terms of F1-score, leading to a 5% increase in click-through rates.' Quantifiable results demonstrate the real-world value you bring to the table.",
                    "**Use 'We' when Discussing Team Projects:** When talking about projects where you collaborated with others, use 'we' instead of 'I' to highlight your teamwork abilities. Even if you played a key role, acknowledge the contributions of your team members. For example, say 'We worked together to build...' instead of 'I built...'. However, be prepared to specifically articulate your individual contributions to the project."
